            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Kodjo Tchinou</strong>. I am from Togo, a small country located in West Africa.
                I have 3 sisters and 2 little brothers. My father is a businessman, and my mother is also involved in business. I am passionate about technology
                and software development. Currently, I am learning <em>Web Design Tools</em> with the amazing professor <strong>Stephen Herd</strong> to build amazing websites, and I am excited about how technology can create positive
                changes in the world. In my spare time, I like to explore new programming languages and work on projects that can help me grow
                as a developer. <em>Learning new skills</em> every day is something I value deeply, as I believe it will
                open up more opportunities for me in the future.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="hobbies">
            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>When I am not coding, I enjoy playing musical instruments such as the <strong>piano</strong> and
                <strong>guitar</strong>. These hobbies allow me to express my creativity in different ways and offer a
                great balance to my tech-focused interests.
                Additionally, I enjoy reading books on a variety of topics, including technology, history, and
                self-improvement. I also play video games as a way to relax and challenge myself. <em>Gaming has taught
                me the importance of teamwork</em> and strategic thinking, which I believe is beneficial in both
                coding and everyday life.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="goals">
            <h2>My Goals</h2>
            <p>One of my main goals is to become a skilled full-stack developer. I want to continue learning more about
                web development and eventually build websites that have a meaningful impact. Through coding, I hope to
                contribute to the development of innovative solutions for the challenges facing my community.
                In the long term, I aim to create in my country <strong>Togo</strong> a tech company that will focus on
                <strong>Educational technology</strong>, providing accessible learning tools to people all over the
                world. I believe that technology can bridge gaps and make education more inclusive.</p>
