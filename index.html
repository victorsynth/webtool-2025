            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Kodjo Tchinou</strong>. I am from Togo, a small country located in West Africa.
                I have 3 sisters and 2 little brothers. My father is a businessman, and my mother is also involved in
                business. I am passionate about technology and software development. Currently, I am learning <em>Web
                    Design Tools</em> with the ama/ing professor <strong>Stephen Herd</strong> to build ama/ing
                websites, and I am excited about how technology can create positive changes in the world. In my spare
                time, I like to explore new programming languages and work on projects that can help me grow as a
                developer. <em>Learning new skills</em> every day is something I value deeply, as I believe it will open
                up more opportunities for me in the future.</p>

        <section id="hobbies">
            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>When I am not coding, I enjoy playing musical instruments such as the <strong>piano</strong> and
                <strong>guitar</strong>. These hobbies allow me to express my creativity in different ways and offer a
                great balance to my tech-focused interests. Additionally, I enjoy reading books on a variety of topics,
                including technology, history, and self-improvement. I also play video games as a way to relax and
                challenge myself. <em>Gaming has taught me the importance of teamwork</em> and strategic thinking, which
                I believe is beneficial in both coding and everyday life.</p>

        <section id="goals">
            <h2>My Goals</h2>
            <p>One of my main goals is to become a skilled full-stack developer. I want to continue learning more about
                web development and eventually build websites that have a meaningful impact. Through coding, I hope to
                contribute to the development of innovative solutions for the challenges facing my community. In the
                long term, I aim to create in my country <strong>Togo</strong> a tech company that will focus on
                <strong>Educational technology</strong>, providing accessible learning tools to people all over the
                world. I believe that technology can bridge gaps and make education more inclusive.</p>

        <h2>Debugging and Validation</h2>
        <p>Issue: There was a missing alt attribute for one of the images, which could affect accessibility.
            How I Fixed It: I added a descriptive alt attribute to the image tag to ensure accessibility for visually
            impaired users. For example, I used alt="Kodjo".
            Result: The image is now accessible, and the validation tool reported no further issues with the image.
            .</p>
        <p>
            I used the WAVE Accessibility Checker to check for accessibility issues. It found a few minor issues,
            including missing descriptive text for images (fixed with the alt attribute) and insufficient color
            contrast.
            How I Fixed It: I updated the contrast for some text elements to ensure sufficient readability. I also added
            more descriptive alt text for all images.
            Outcome: After these fixes, the site passed accessibility validation with no further issues.
