            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Kodjo Tchinou</strong>. I am from Togo, a small but vibrant country located in West Africa. I have 3 sisters and 2 little brothers, and we share a strong bond. My father is a businessman, and my mother also works in the business field, which has inspired me to pursue my own ventures.</p>
            <p>I am deeply passionate about technology and software development. At the moment, I am focusing on learning <em>Web Design Tools</em> through the guidance of the amazing professor <strong>Stephen Herd</strong>. Building websites has always fascinated me because I believe that the digital world holds incredible potential to solve real-world problems. The ability to bring creative ideas to life through coding excites me, and I am eager to continue improving my skills.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy exploring new programming languages, which helps me to expand my knowledge and adaptability in the ever-evolving tech industry. I value the importance of constantly learning, as I believe this will open up more opportunities for me in the future, both personally and professionally.</p>

        <section id="hobbies">
            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>When Iâ€™m not working on coding projects, I enjoy playing musical instruments like the <strong>piano</strong> and <strong>guitar</strong>. These hobbies allow me to express my creativity in ways that balance out my tech-focused interests. Music offers a unique form of expression and relaxation, which helps me refresh my mind and approach my work with renewed energy.</p>
            <p>Reading is another one of my favorite activities. I devour books on a wide range of topics, from technology to history and personal development. I find that reading not only broadens my knowledge but also helps me think critically about the world around me. In addition to books, I am an avid gamer. Video games allow me to escape into different worlds and engage in strategic thinking and problem-solving. Gaming has also taught me the importance of teamwork, which is something I apply to my coding projects. Whether working on a team or as an individual, collaboration and communication are key to success.</p>
            <p>Through these hobbies, I believe I am able to create a well-rounded and fulfilling lifestyle. Balancing my tech interests with creative outlets like music and gaming gives me the mental clarity and inspiration I need to tackle new challenges in both my personal and professional life.</p>

        <section id="goals">
            <h2>My Goals</h2>
            <p>One of my major goals is to become a skilled full-stack developer. I am working diligently to expand my knowledge of both front-end and back-end development to create seamless and impactful websites. I want to build applications that can make a difference, whether it's improving accessibility, simplifying processes, or helping people connect in meaningful ways. The ability to work on both sides of the web development spectrum will allow me to build complete, functional systems that can have a lasting impact on users.</p>
            <p>In addition to my technical aspirations, I also have long-term goals that focus on giving back to my community in Togo. I aspire to establish a tech company that specializes in <strong>Educational Technology</strong>, providing accessible learning tools to people all over the world, but particularly in Africa. There is a growing need for accessible educational resources in many parts of the world, and I believe that technology can bridge the gap and create more inclusive educational systems. Through this company, I hope to empower individuals to access quality education, regardless of their geographical or financial limitations.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, I aim to inspire others in my community to pursue careers in technology, particularly those who may not have had the resources or opportunities to do so. I believe that technology has the power to change lives, and I am passionate about making it more accessible to people in every corner of the globe.</p>
